        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p> have proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C, and JavaScript. My back-end development skills include working with Django and FastAPI, while my front-end expertise encompasses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I am experienced with databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, and I have practical knowledge of web technologies like Docker. Additionally, I am well-versed in developer tools such as Git, VS Code, and Atom.</p>
        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <p>I am quick to adapt, skilled at prioritizing tasks, persuasive, collaborative, driven, and innovative.</p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>As a Web Developer Intern at Genpro Research in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, from May 2023 to August 2023, I developed 'envstore,' a robust environment file storage system using FastAPI and SQL. This project enhanced development efficiency by 7%, streamlining environment switching across branches. I demonstrated proficiency in FastAPI, SQL, Docker, and Git for back-end development. By adopting an agile and solution-oriented approach, I improved the development workflow by approximately 10%. I also collaborated effectively with a team of four developers.</p>

        <h3>Projects & Research</h3>
        <p>I developed a Computer Lab Monitoring Tool using FastAPI, which monitors computer labs, individual machines, and networks. This tool increased efficiency by 20% and resolved IT issues 35% faster. Additionally, I upgraded the back-end of my college website using Django, implementing new features for a streamlined user experience and boosted engagement. I am also conducting ongoing research on analogue computing, where I designed an analog circuit that achieves 70% faster computation for NP-hard problems (0/1 integer) compared to digital methods.</p>

        <h3>Achievements & Activities</h3>
        <p>I won first prize in an inter-collegiate coding competition awarded by the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). I achieved third prize (Honorable Mention) at a national-level Model United Nations competition among over 120 participants, demonstrating strong diplomacy and negotiation abilities. As a coordinator, I organized HACK4TKM, Latency 2.0, and Kraft Night, which are national-level hackathons hosted at my college, attracting over 1000 registrations and 140 teams. I also contributed to social work by participating in a departmental workshop organized by YIP under the Kerala Startup Mission and organized technical workshops for over 100 students.</p>

        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>As a coordinator for IEDC TKMCE, I coordinated events like Latency, Kraft Night, and HACK4TKM. I secured funding, strengthened alumni ties, and promoted student startups. Additionally, as a member of XLR8, the student formula team, I played a key role in vehicle dynamics, managing and directing the team to produce a track-worthy car.</p>
